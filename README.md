# Exploring Public Sentiment on Twitter with NLP

This project focuses on applying natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze public sentiment on Twitter. Using Python libraries such as VADER and Gensim, we process unstructured Twitter data to gain insights into people's views, specifically opinions related to COVID-19.

## Project Overview

The project leverages a dataset containing over 100,000 tweets about COVID-19 from users worldwide. The goal is to conduct sentiment analysis, identify trends, and apply topic modeling to understand the themes and sentiment expressed across this large volume of tweets.

### Key Features
- Handle and clean unstructured Twitter data using Python.
- Perform sentiment analysis using VADER, specifically tailored for social media language.
- Identify and visualize sentiment trends over time.
- Apply topic modeling with Gensim to uncover common themes in the tweets.

### Libraries and Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **NLTK**: For text preprocessing and sentiment analysis.
- **Pandas**: To handle and organize the raw Twitter data.
- **Gensim**: For topic modeling and uncovering patterns in the data.

### Project Steps
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Organize and clean raw Twitter data to make it suitable for analysis.
2. **Sentiment Analysis**: Apply VADER to assess sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) in tweets.
3. **Sentiment Trend Visualization**: Use visualizations to explore sentiment trends over time.
4. **Topic Modeling**: Apply Gensim to discover key topics discussed in tweets related to COVID-19.

### Outcome
The project provides an overview of global sentiment regarding COVID-19 and uses visualizations to present key findings. The analysis helps in understanding the social media landscape and how public opinion is shaped over time on platforms like Twitter.
